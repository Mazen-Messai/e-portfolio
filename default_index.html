                I’m a computer science student at ENSEEIHT who has always enjoyed exploring the connections between mathematics and computer science, fueling my curiosity and drive to solve complex problems. 
                These passions inspire me to pursue a career in research, where I can contribute to innovative advancements at the intersection of these fields.
            </p>
            <p  style="font-size: 1.2rem;">
                Beyond academics, I enjoy engaging in sports, exploring the arts, and participating in both athletic and algorithmic competitions. 
                I’m also involved in several projects and love writing short articles about them in my free time—feel free to check them out!

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="highlight-text">
                After two rigorous years in <em>Classe Préparatoire</em>, where I extensively studied mathematics and computer science, I took France's prestigious engineering school entrance exams and successfully gained admission to ENSEEIHT, 
                the second highest-ranked school in computer science. It has always been my dream school due to its renowned mathematics curriculum.
            </p>
            
            <p class="highlight-text">
                It was during <em>Classe Préparatoire</em> that I truly discovered my passion for problem-solving and computer science, a field that was once merely an interest. Since then, I have been certain that I want to pursue a career in research within computer science, particularly in areas that bridge the gap between mathematics and computing, such as machine learning.
            </p>
            
            <p class="highlight-text">
                However, my journey into problem solving began much earlier! At the age of ten, I qualified for the French Junior Mathematical Olympiad finals! Since that moment, I've found immense joy in solving complex problems, whether it be tackling LeetCode challenges or participating in competitions like SWERC or Prologin.

                    <p class="project-description">
                        We've all faced storage issues, but thankfully compression algorithms exist! <br>
                        During my first year at ENSEEIHT, I wrote a program that compresses files using the Huffman algorithm. Through this project, I became more familiar with concepts such as genericity and package writing.

                        Fractals can be so fascinating! Beyond the mathematical aspect, plotting them efficiently can be quite a challenge. <br>
                        For this project, I used C and the Raylib library. The next step is to use OpenGL to improve performance.

                        During my time in <em>Classe Préparatoire</em>, I wanted to dive deeper into game theory. <br>
                        That's why I decided to study the 2048 game with a friend. Together, we developed several AIs and compared their performance. The objective was to build a solid methodology for creating AIs in games.
                        We obtained some fascinating results and quickly realized that choosing an algorithm requires considering several factors, such as the role of randomness in the game, the influence of mathematical patterns, and more. <br>
