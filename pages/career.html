        <section class="study-content">
        <p>Throughout my academic and extracurricular journey, I have actively pursued opportunities to deepen my understanding of computer science and mathematics while contributing to meaningful projects.</p>
	    <p>I have participated in algorithmic competitions such as SWERC and Prologin, where I had the chance to meet researchers from Huawei and developers from JetBrains. These experiences have sharpened my problem-solving skills and opened doors to potential opportunities, such as a summer internship at Jane Street—one of the rare companies that uses the magnificent OCaml language (perhaps proving that good taste in programming languages still exists!).</p>
	    <p>I aspire to become a researcher at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, with a particular interest in quantum computing. My ultimate goal is to work for companies like Alice & Bob. I am currently in contact with one of their employees regarding a potential internship.</p>
	    <p>I am preparing to turn one of my projects, developed with a close high school friend and classmate, into a business. The project aims to create software for geography teachers in France’s national education system, allowing them to digitize the creation of maps and sketches.</p>
	    <p>I lead a project for a for-profit association specializing in video production and event services (e.g., filming events, concert lighting). This project involves developing a wiring diagram software tailored to their needs.</p>
	    <p>Recently, I initiated a SaaS project with a friend who is both a developer and entrepreneur. The platform focuses on helping small businesses manage their HR tasks, such as recruiting, sorting CVs, generating payslips, and allowing employees to plan their time off.</p>
	    <p>I am currently working on an upcoming paper about Perlin noise and its applications in procedural generation. This research explores how proper use of random generation can create stunning terrains in games like Minecraft, bridging the gap between mathematical elegance and creative design in virtual worlds.</p>
        <p>Through these experiences, I aim to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical innovation, while building skills essential for future research and entrepreneurial ventures.</p>
