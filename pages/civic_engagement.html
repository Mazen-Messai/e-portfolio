        <section class="study-content">
        
            <p>From a young age, I’ve been committed to making a positive impact in my community through various roles and projects. My civic journey began in middle school when I joined the <em>Conseil Municipal des Jeunes</em> in my city, where I served for three years. This opportunity allowed me to be involved in meaningful community initiatives, including the creation of the <em>Baguette Suspendue</em> project. This initiative, still ongoing today, encourages people to purchase extra baguettes at local bakeries. These baguettes are then collected and distributed by <em>Les Restos du Cœur</em> to people in need, providing fresh bread for those facing food insecurity.</p>
        
            <p>My involvement continued through my role as a class representative during high school, my <em>Classes Préparatoires</em>, and my time in engineering school. Serving as a student representative allowed me to advocate for my peers, helping to foster a supportive and inclusive environment.</p>
        
            <p>I am also proud to participate in <em>Les Cordées de la Réussite</em>, an initiative that supports students from underprivileged neighborhoods. By mentoring middle school students, I help them envision and plan their future projects, sharing skills and encouragement to inspire confidence in their potential.</p>
        
            <p>In addition, I volunteer regularly with charities, participate in local <em>maraudes</em> to distribute essentials to homeless individuals, and have raised funds for initiatives like the <em>Téléthon</em>. Most recently, I joined the <em>Octobre Rose</em> run to raise awareness and support for breast cancer research.
                
            <p>I have volunteered at the <em>Capitole du Libre</em>, a major event dedicated to free software and hardware, too. I staffed in the Install Party room, where we assisted attendees with installing Linux systems and repairing their devices. Additionally, I helped out at the crêpe stand, contributing to the event’s friendly and welcoming atmosphere.</p>
        
            <p>Through these experiences, I am continually inspired by the power of collective action and am committed to continuing my civic engagement, working towards a more inclusive and compassionate community.</p>
